3.Will the order of execution be same always or could be different? Will it impact the output?
Yes, order of execution depends on which process gets the first thread. Hence it will impact the output as to which process prints first.

4.Why the first printf() statement will be executed only by parent process and not by child process?
Because child process doesnâ€™t exist until then, hence parent process only will print it.
